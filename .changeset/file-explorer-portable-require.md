'@lynxtron-examples/file-explorer': patch
---

Stop baking the build machine's absolute `import.meta.url` into the packaged host bundle. The `@lynx-js/lynxtron` ESM shim calls `createRequire(import.meta.url)`, which rspack inlined as a build-time `file://` path (e.g. a macOS CI runner path) and crashed the app with `ERR_INVALID_ARG_VALUE` when the showcase was installed on another machine or OS. Define `import.meta.url` as `__filename` so the require base resolves to the shipped `main.js` at runtime.
